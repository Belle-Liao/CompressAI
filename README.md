## Assignment Overview

### NYCU 2023 Video Compression - Final Project

The goal of our final project is to compress images, such as satellite aerial photos, where color information is less critical.

We first convert the images to black and white before proceeding with image compression to significantly reduce file size. Finally, we apply a coloring process. Despite the fact that the colors may not match those of the original image, this approach satisfies the requirements since color does not provide crucial information in such images.

This code corresponds to the **compression** phase of the project.

## Environment

The dataset are put in the file `formal`.

Please run `CompressAI_Models_Comparison_Demo_ipynb.ipynb` at **Google Colab**.
